# Weather Widget

## Development

To start the app locally 

```bash
npm install 
```

then

```bash
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Stack

- Typescript
- React.js
- React router
- Styled components
- Context API and hooks for state management

## Notes

- the link to the weather API attached in the task opened to a blank page and would not response, I tried exploring the website a little bit to find any data or other weather APIs but I couldn't. So I used this [API](https://openweathermap.org/current)  instead. It returned all of the data needed to complete the features of the task.

## Enhancements

- Adding Favorite cities list, using local sorage.
- Animatint the diffrent backgrounds.
