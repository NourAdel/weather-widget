# Weather Widget

## Development

```bash
npm install 
```

then

```bash
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Stack

- Typescript
- React.js
- React router
- Styled components
- Context API and hooks for state management

## Notes

- The link to the weather API attached to the task opened to a blank page, I tried exploring the website a little bit to find any data or other weather APIs, but I couldn't. So I used this [API](https://openweathermap.org/current)  instead. It returned all of the data needed to complete the features and functionalities of the task.

## Enhancements

- Adding Favorite cities list, using local storage.
- Animating the different backgrounds.
